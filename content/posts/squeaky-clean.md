How to judge a day? Yesterday was a great success on the domestic front. We
ran the water maker for two hours and so got our water
tanks full to the brim again, which meant we could all shower. It is
difficult to explain just how nice it feels to be squeaky clean again after
three or four days of feeling continually sticky. The problem is that no
sooner have you dried yourself than the clamminess starts to creep
back. We also hoovered (or, more accurately, Dysoned) and cleaned the
inside of the boat from top to bottom, and as mentioned
yesterday, Vanessa even broke out the polish.

Things were not quite so successful on the outside of the boat. On the plus
side, nothing broke. Even the Blue Water Runner refrained
from making another leap for the sea, but our progress westwards was
painfully slow. There just isn't enough wind. Trying to keep up
moral is challenging; you know when you start getting excited about little
clumps of seaweed drifting past that cabin fever is starting to
creep in. We do our best to keep ourselves entertained, but there's only so
many times you can play I spy with my little eye something
beginning "s".

At 1 a.m. last night the wind died completely and so we were faced with the
choice of lolling around in the swell on putting the engine on.
I'm afraid we chose the latter. Hopefully we'll have something more
exciting to report tomorrow, like a breaching whale or a pod of
dolphins. Even the return of Maverick would help break the boredom!
