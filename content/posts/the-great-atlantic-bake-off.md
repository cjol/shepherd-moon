Yesterday was a day of multiple sail changes, as the wind shifted between
southeast to east and we swapped between the gennaker
and the Blue Water Runner (we are heading west; the Blue Water Runner likes
the wind dead behind i.e. easterly, but the gennaker -
which is faster, better behaved, and, most importantly, prettier - likes
the wind with a bit of south in it. Who would have thought sails could
be such prima donnas). We have got this swapping down to a fine art now. I
release the halyard from the mast and control the descent of
the sail, Jacob makes sure it doesn't get tangled on the way down (and in
the case of the Blue Water Runner, that it doesn't make a leap
for the sea) and Vanessa hauls the sail through the forward hatch into the
forecabin. It's then a case of swapping over the sheets and
halyard to the new sail, and then up she goes. We can probably do the whole
exercise in just under 10 minutes but it's very tiring on the
arms.

In the middle of these repeated sail changes Vanessa thought it would be a
lovely idea to make bread. We have a few packets of bread
mix which makes the whole process a lot easier, but the one thing we are
lacking is flour. Have you ever tried needing dough without
flouring the surface or your hands first? The end result is the kind of
stickiness you could normally only achieve by giving a toddler an ice
cream on a hot sunny day. Vanessa, normally so mild mannered and softly
spoken, didn't react well when I suggested we might want to
change sails just as she was armpit deep in sticky dough! Anyway, the bread
tasted delicious and so justified the near marital breakdown.

In other culinary news, we have invented a new biscuit that we plan to
patent when we get home. You take a packet of bourbon biscuits
and keep it in a Tupperware box containing a few packets of Polos. You then
leave it there until it's 11-months past its sell by date, and
then consume. The end result is slightly soft but very minty tasting; like
an After Eight in biscuit form - yummy.
